📌 Volume Control Using Finger Gestures

Control your PC's volume in real-time using just your fingers and a webcam! This project leverages MediaPipe Hand Tracking, OpenCV, and Pycaw to adjust volume based on the distance between your thumb and index finger. Additionally, an open palm gesture can play/pause media.
